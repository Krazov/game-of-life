## Basics

* Buttons: invert

## Features

* Count how long current state is holding on
* Player defined board size
* Board visual size adjusting to board rows and columns number (CSS)

## Meta programming

* Tail call optimization (probably not possible with setTimeout)
* Single array
* Native modules?
* Comment code, even for yourself in the future

## Future plans
